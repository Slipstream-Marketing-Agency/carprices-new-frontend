              <strong>1. SCOPE OF THIS POLICY AND YOUR&nbsp;CONSENT</strong>

            </ol>
            This policy governs our processing of your information in relation to the

            your consent to the processing of your information described&nbsp;herein.
            <ol className='mt-3'>

              <strong>2. INFORMATION WE MAY&nbsp;COLLECT</strong>

            </ol>
            The type of information we collect will depend on the circumstances and the
            service you are using. For example, to sign up to a newsletter we may only
            need your name and email address but if you want to attend one of our events
            we may need to know your contact details, payment information and any access
            or dietary requirements. Generally speaking, we will collect information
            relating to you and/or your use of our services in the following&nbsp;ways:
          </div>

          <br />
          <strong>Personal information provided by&nbsp;you:</strong>
          <br />
          This is usually information that identifies you as an individual or that
          enables us to contact you and can include your name, home and/or delivery
          address, telephone number, e-mail address, data of birth, demographical
          information, interests, preferences, payment information and photos or video
          footage. It can also include information that we have not requested but which
          you have volunteered, such as information provided during interactions with
          our customer service agents or via comments or other submissions you have made
          to our online services, such as online&nbsp;forums. In some circumstances you
          might provide us with information about other individuals, for example when
          using a ‘send to a friend’ feature or submitting a photo that includes their
          image. You must ensure you have their permission to provide their information
          to us; and you have made them aware of the terms of this privacy&nbsp;policy.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            Information collected automatically during your use of our&nbsp;services:
          </strong>
          <br />
          When you use our services we automatically record information about your usage
          of those services, your interaction with our adverts and our emails as well as
          information about the device you are using and your internet connection. We do
          this in two&nbsp;ways:
          <br />
          Log data: When you use our services, certain information gets recorded in our
          log files such as your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) Address, its unique ID,
          its operating system and location, and your browser type, the pages you
          viewed, cookie information and referral links (the link that sent you to a
          particular&nbsp;page).
          <br />
          Tracking technologies (cookies): In conjunction with our log data we may use
          tracking technologies such as tags on our web pages and small data files which
          we store on your device (known as “cookies”). These technologies enable us to
          recognise your device and to track your interaction with our services, emails
          and adverts. We do not use these technologies to identify you and we do not
          intentionally collect or record personally identifiable information through
          these technologies. See our Cookies Policy for more&nbsp;information's
          <br />
          Information collected via social media and other third&nbsp;parties:
          <br />
          When you choose to participate in or receive a service from us via social
          media, for example by entering a competition or playing a game on our social
          pages, we may collect information from you directly or the social network may
          share with us personal information about you. This can consist of information
          such as your name, profile picture, gender, e-mail address and date of birth.

          also be subject to that third party’s privacy&nbsp;policy.

          Generally, we will only disclose your data to other parties with your consent,
          for example if you choose to share content via social media functionality. We
          may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement agencies,
          government/regulatory bodies, internet service providers and content
          protection organizations as required or allowed by law. For example, if you
          post inappropriate or objectionable content on our services or where we
          reasonably believe you may be in breach of the law, we may report your content

          We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event we
          sell or transfer all or a part of our business or assets so that the buyer can
          continue to offer you the online services. We will make reasonable efforts to

            </ol>
          </strong>
          Processing your data in countries such as the United States involves
          transferring your data outside the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Many of our
          external third parties are also based outside the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
          so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data
          outside the&nbsp;UAE. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UAE,
          we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at
          least one of the following safeguards is&nbsp;implemented: We will only
          transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an
          adequate level of protection for personal data. Where we use providers based
          in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield
          which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared
          between the UAE and the US. Please contact us if you want further information
          on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out
          of the&nbsp;UAE.

          </strong>
          We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is
          necessary for the relevant service or as long as is set out in any relevant
          contract you hold with us, in accordance with our retention policy. Where you
          contribute to one of our online services, we will generally only keep your
          content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it
          was submitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;After this time, your personal information will
          either be securely deleted or anonymized so that it can be used for

          personal information from children under the age of 15. If you are aged 14 or

          our&nbsp;services.

          If you are the parent or guardian of a child who is aged under 15 and you

          We maintain appropriate organisational and technological safeguards to help

          service providers do the same. Unfortunately, no system can be guaranteed as
          completely secure and there is an inherent risk in transmitting information
          over the internet. It may be possible for an unrelated party to intercept or
          access such transmissions&nbsp;unlawfully.

          <strong>Your Legal&nbsp;Rights</strong>
          <br />
          You have the following&nbsp;rights:
          <br />
          Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access
          request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold
          about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you
          would like to know what information we hold about you, you may submit a
          request to us by using the contact details&nbsp;below.
          <br />
          <br />
          We will require you to prove your identity before granting access to your
          personal information. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal
          data (or to exercise any of the other rights detailed below). However, we may
          be entitled to charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded,
          repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your
          request in these&nbsp;circumstances.
          <br />
          <br />
          We will process your request within the timeframe&nbsp;required.
          <br />
          <br />
          Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables
          you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected,
          though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide
          to&nbsp;us.
          <br />
          <br />
          Request erasure (deletion) of your personal data. This enables you to ask us
          to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
          continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
          remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to
          object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
          unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with
          local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
          request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you,
          if applicable, at the time of your&nbsp;request.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you would like us to delete your information from our records then please
          contact us using the details below and we will respond within a reasonable
          time but within no more than 3 working days. Please note that we may be
          required to retain certain information by law and/or for own legitimate
          business&nbsp;purposes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a
          legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about
          your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this
          ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
          <br />
          <br />
          Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to
          ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following
          scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our
          use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you
          need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to
          establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our
          use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
          grounds to use&nbsp;it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your
          personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing
          carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we
          may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise
          you if this is the case at the time you&nbsp;withdraw.
