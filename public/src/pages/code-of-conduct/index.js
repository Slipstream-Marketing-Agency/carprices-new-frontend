                    We want all visitors to our websites to have a safe, interesting and friendly
                    experience. Accordingly, all users of our sites and any contributions they
                    make to the sites must comply with this Code of Conduct. Your use of our
                    websites means that you accept and agree to abide by this Code of Conduct,
                    which supplements and forms part of the Website Terms (which you can access by
                    clicking on the link at the bottom of our websites). We may need to revise the
                    Code of Conduct from time to time by amending this page. Please review this
                    page regularly to ensure you are aware of any changes we make as they are
                    legally binding on you. If you reasonably believe that any contribution to our
                    websites made by another user contravenes this Code of Conduct and/or any of
                    the Website Terms, please notify us on our email: complaints@carprices.ae
                    Within this Code of Conduct, "contribution" means any material posted or
                    uploaded to our websites by a member of the public, including without
                    limitation any text, photographs, graphics, video or audio material.

                            must not infringe anyone else's rights, including copyright. Your
                            contributions must not plagiarise or infringe the rights of any other
                            person including any copyright, database, trade mark, trade secret,

                            with regard to existing articles, news reports, music, video clips or
                            other copyright material you will generally need the explicit permission
                            of the relevant copyright owners

                            members, even if you disagree with them. Material that is unlawful,
                            harassing, threatening, defamatory, obscene, offensive, abusive, hateful,
                            inflammatory, profane, racially, sexually or religiously offensive or
                            otherwise objectionable or unlawful is not acceptable.

                            to pornography, commercial or other inappropriate content may be deleted.

                            must not promote illegal or anti-social behaviour. Contributions must not
                            contain violent or sexually explicit material or advocate, promote or
                            assist any unlawful act such as (by way of example only) terrorist acts,
                            copyright infringement or computer misuse.

                        <li>
                            must not misrepresent their origins. Contributions and/or user names may
                            not be used to impersonate any other person, to misrepresent your identity
                            or affiliation with any person or to give the impression that they emanate
                            from us, if that is not the case.

                            must not be in any language other than English (or the predominant
                            language of the website if not English). Contributions in other languages
                            may be removed.

                            must not involve any flooding, spamming or advertising. Flooding is when
                            the same comment is posted over and over in the same forum; spamming is
                            the posting of the same comment (or very similar) to more than one forum.
                            All advertisements, chain letters, pyramid schemes, junk mail and any
                            other forms of commercial solicitation are prohibited.

                    It will be our sole decision as to whether there has been a breach of this
                    Code of Conduct. We have the right (but not the obligation) to edit, refuse to
                    post, or to remove any contribution in whole or in part that we deem to be in
                    breach of the Code of Conduct. Where we believe there is a breach of the Code
                    of Conduct, we may take whatever action we feel is appropriate in the
                    circumstances. Failure to comply with this Code of Conduct constitutes a
                    material breach of the Website Terms, which could result in us taking any of
                    the following actions:

                        <li>issuing a warning to you;</li>

                            your right to use our websites, including deletion of any personal
                            profile;

                        <li>

                            an indemnity basis (including, but not limited to, reasonable
                            administrative and legal costs) resulting from the breach and/or further
                            legal action against you; and/or
                        </li>

                            disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities or other
                            relevant third parties as we reasonably feel is necessary.

                    We exclude liability for actions taken in response to breaches of this Code of
